# PCAn - Point Centromere Annotation

This repository contains the scripts used for building the tool PCAn and subsequent phylogenetic analyses (profiling of kinetochore proteins, species tree reconstruction and dating) described in [Helsen et al. 2025](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.01.16.633479v1). This repository is divided into
1. [PCAn](https://github.com/JHelsen/point-centromere-detection/tree/main/PCAn) - how to install and use the tool with an example included
2. [species-tree-reconstruction](https://github.com/JHelsen/point-centromere-detection/tree/main/species-tree-reconstruction) - scripts used to reconstruct the species tree in the study 
3. [homology-searches](https://github.com/JHelsen/point-centromere-detection/tree/main/homology-searches) - scripts used to perform homology searches for kinetochore proteins
4. [cen-simulations](https://github.com/JHelsen/point-centromere-detection/tree/main/cen-evolution-simulations) - script used for the simulations described in the study (this can be run in the conda environment created during the PCAn installation)
   
The files required to create the conda environment are included in each directory

### Future plans
PCAn is ready for use and can be installed and used by following the instructions in the PCAn folder. For other directories, we aim to improve the documentation.

### Contact
For any assistance for running either PCAn or any of the other scripts, please either raise an issue on this GitHub repo or contact either Jana Helsen (the owner of this repo) or [Kausthubh Ramachandran](https://github.com/kausthubhr/)
