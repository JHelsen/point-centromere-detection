# PCAn - Point Centromere Annotation

This repository contains the scripts used for building the tool PCAn and subsequent phylogenetic analyses (profiling of kinetochore proteins, species tree reconstruction and dating) described in [Helsen et al. 2025](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.01.16.633479v1). This repository is divided into
1. PCAn - how to install and use the tool with an example included
2. species-tree-reconstruction - scripts used to reconstruct the species tree in the study 
3. homology-searches - scripts used to perform homology searches for kinetochore proteins
4. cen-simulations - script used for the simulations described in the study (this can be run in the conda environment used in the PCAn installation)
   
The files required to create the conda environment are included in each directory
